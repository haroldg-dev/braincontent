## Why Use SSH keys?

SSH keys provide a secure way to authenticate with remote repositories, eliminating the need to enter your username and password every time you interact with Git. They enhance security and streamline your workflow.

### Generate SSH Key Pair

- On Linux/macOS:
  Open a terminal and enter the following command, replacing the email with the one associated with your Git account.

- On Windows:
  For Windows users, you can use the Git Bash terminal that comes with Git. Enter the same command as above in the Git Bash terminal.

```
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.user@example.com"
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.user@example.com"
```

### Add SSH key to SSH Agent

The SSH agent is a background process that manages your SSH keys. Run the following commands to add your SSH key to the agent:

```
# Start the SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your SSH key to the agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### Copy your SSH key to your account

```
$ ssh-add -L
```

### Test your connection

```
ssh -T git@github.com   # For GitHub
ssh -T git@gitlab.com   # For GitLab
ssh -T git@bitbucket.org   # For Bitbucket
```
